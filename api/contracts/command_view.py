"""Normalized command-view read model (Block 4 §6 risk-watch + §7 command view).

Overview MUST NOT parse raw ``structured_plan``. It consumes this normalized,
derived read model instead, so Overview stays cheap to render and resilient to
``structured_plan`` schema changes.

The command view is **derived** state — built from the persisted plan, the
latest valid recommendation, completion records, and session data. It is not a
new source of truth. Missing inputs degrade to a clean empty state rather than
crashing.
