"""Stamp planner-owned exercise identity (``SessionBlock.exercise_key``) onto blocks.

The planner decides identity; the model decides wording. Every
``selected_exercise_assignments`` entry carries the ``exercise_key`` of its
canonical bank exercise from the moment it is selected
(``fightcamp.exercise_identity``). Stage 2 then renders each session however it
likes ("4 x 5 explosive throws"), and this module stamps the planner's key back
onto the block that renders each assignment, using the plan's own locked
membership rather than rediscovering identity from copy:

1. **Session -> role.** Each converted session is tied to the planner role it
   renders by the shared session-identity matcher (deterministic session id,
   then the role's athlete-facing label), on the role's own countdown day (or
   weekday, for open plans).
2. **Block -> assignment.** Within that session a block naming an assignment
   takes its key; the remaining blocks take the remaining assignments in planner
   order when the counts agree exactly (warm-up/cool-down blocks the converter
   added are set aside first). A count mismatch stamps nothing rather than guess.
3. **Support inserts.** A gap-fill insert prescribes one known movement
   (``support_insert_exercise_key``); its session's dose-copy blocks take it.
4. **Legacy fallbacks.** A block named exactly like a candidate-pool option, or
   a key a deterministic builder stamped from the block's own name, is kept.

The model is never a source of a key: anything not derived here is cleared.
Non-physical blocks (mindset, nutrition, coach-led sparring) never carry one.
