"""Region-aware Rehab/Prehab labelling for a plan's rehab blocks.

Rehab work stays named "Rehab" only while the body region it targets is actually
injured. Once that injury clears, the same drill is prophylactic and reads
"Prehab" — even if the athlete is carrying an unrelated injury elsewhere. A
cleared hamstring must not keep reading "Rehab" just because a quad is sore.

The plan's structured blocks carry no injury link (``block_id`` is a slug of the
drill name), so the match is textual. This module resolves each live injury flag
to a canonical body region and expands it into the match terms a client can scan
a block's text for; the per-block decision itself lives in
``web/lib/rehab-label.ts`` so both render surfaces (Plan detail and Today) share
one rule.

Fail-safe in both directions:
  * a live injury whose region cannot be resolved makes ``default_mode`` "rehab",
    because an unlocalised injury cannot be region-matched and guessing "prehab"
    would understate it;
  * any store failure degrades to a bare "rehab" policy, the pre-existing
    behaviour.
