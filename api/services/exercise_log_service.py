"""Log what an athlete actually did for one prescribed block today.

A log never edits the plan. It records the block as prescribed (a frozen copy)
beside what was done, keyed on the block's server-owned ``block_id``.

Logging is only open for a session the athlete has started or completed today.
That is deliberate: every gate on training itself (rest day, safety hold,
severe injury, check-in, stale prescription) is enforced once, on the session
start, and a log can never record work the athlete was not cleared to begin.

Optional work (the camp Fight Visualisation) never gets a completion row of its
own when the day starts: it sits outside the day unit. Its blocks can still be
logged once the day is started, so the athlete can say it was done.

Rehab blocks are not logged here. Their dose is recorded by the rehab
completion flow, which owns rehab evidence.
