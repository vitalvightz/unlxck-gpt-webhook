"""Apply an athlete's exercise swaps, additions and removals to a projected card.

The generated card in ``plans.structured_plan`` is never edited. An athlete's
changes live beside it in ``plans.exercise_overrides`` and are applied here,
after the calendar is projected onto dates, by every reader of the effective
plan: Plan Detail (``api.plan_mappers``), Today, session start and exercise
logging (``api.services.today_service._projected_structured_plan``). One pure
function means every surface shows the same effective workout.

An entry is one change:

* ``action``: ``swap`` (replace one block), ``remove`` (drop one block) or
  ``add`` (append one block to a session).
* ``scope``: ``occurrence`` applies on ``date`` only. ``future`` applies on
  ``date`` and every later date with the same ``weekday`` in an open plan, to
  the same workout (``session_slot``) and the same exercise (``target_key``),
  so a four-week template whose weeks carry different ids still follows it.
* ``original``: the block as prescribed when the change was made (provenance;
  never re-applied).
* ``block``: the athlete's selection, already built and checked server-side.
* ``revoked_at``: set by Undo / Restore. Revoked entries are kept as history.
* ``ends_before``: a recurring change stopped by Restore after it had already
  applied to started or past workouts; those dates keep it.

Days without a calendar date are left alone: a change always names a date, and
an undated card has no occurrence to attach it to. Rehab blocks are protected
here as well as at write time — they are owned by the injury system.
