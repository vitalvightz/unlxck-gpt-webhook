"""Route-level fail-safe boundary for Today readiness and session execution.

This is the thin HTTP-facing boundary. It does NOT invent readiness semantics:
all status/severity/typed-signal decisions are delegated to the single canonical
authority, :mod:`api.services.readiness_failsafe`. The boundary only adds the
route-level protections the pure service cannot express on its own:

* **Check-in** — delegated straight to ``today_service.submit_today_checkin``,
  which already fails closed and emits the canonical typed signal (a failed
  safety read can never persist ``train_as_planned``; unavailable injury/schedule
  context becomes ``pull_back``). No second decision layer here.
* **Session completion** — blocks *current-session execution* (started / done /
  modified) with a retryable ``503`` when active injury state cannot be verified.
* **Injury reconciliation** — refuses to run when open injury flags cannot be
  read, so a failed read never masquerades as an empty injury set (which would
  create duplicates or clear real injuries).
* **Command view** — revokes/softens a STALE stored green recommendation when
  live safety context cannot be verified, using the canonical fail-safe floor.

The public functions mirror ``api.services.today_service`` so the router imports
one module without changing API contracts.
