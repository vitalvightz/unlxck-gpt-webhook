"""Block 4 Today/Overview orchestration: connect the pure contracts in
``api/contracts`` to persistence (``api/store.py``).

Everything here is server-authoritative:

* the **training day** is computed from the athlete's timezone (03:00 rollover),
  never supplied by the client;
* the **recommendation** is computed by the readiness-message engine and persisted on the
  check-in row — the client never calculates or supplies it;
* the **command view** and **landing** state are derived from persisted rows.

No saved plan is ever mutated here. Readiness text comes from the deterministic
