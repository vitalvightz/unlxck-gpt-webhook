"""Faithfulness gate: prove a structured_plan is a projection of the Stage 2 text.

The structured card the athlete actually sees is a *second* LLM conversion of the
validated Stage 2 ``final_plan_text``. Schema validity alone does not prove the
card reflects that text — the model can introduce exercises that were never
prescribed, invent countdown (D-day) markers, or move work into the wrong day.
This module compares the generated structured plan against the source markdown
and reports any content the card *introduced* or *misplaced*, so a card that can
not be proven faithful is rejected in favour of the validated text / raw-markdown
fallback. ``final_plan_text`` stays the single source of truth; the structured
plan is allowed through only as a verified projection of it.

Design rules (mirrors ``structured_plan_safety`` conventions):

* Fail-closed but low false-positive. Only CLEAR drift is flagged:
  - INTRODUCED: a training-block exercise whose name shares *no* meaningful token
    with the source text (a fabricated exercise), or a countdown marker absent
    from the source.
  - MISPLACED: an exercise the source assigns to exactly one D-day, placed by the
    card under a *different* D-day (e.g. Pallof moved out of its session).
  - LOCKED_CONTENT: wording from a governed ``selected_drill_locked`` role that
    appears in the approved source has been removed or rewritten in the card.
  - PRESCRIPTION: explicit rest, effort, or execution-cue data present on an
    exact source exercise was omitted by the structured conversion. This is an
    advisory consumed by the source-backed renderer, not grounds to discard an
    otherwise valid card; the other finding types remain blocking.
  A reworded exercise that keeps any meaningful token (``Back Squat`` ->
  ``Barbell Back Squat``) passes. Generic/contextual blocks (mindset, nutrition,
  recovery, mobility, preparation, cooldown) are wording the conversion owns, not
  exercise selection, so they are never exercise-name checked.
* The whole check only runs when the source looks like a real countdown plan
  (it carries at least one ``D-N`` day marker). Stubs / degenerate text are not
  evaluated, so the gate can never reject a card it has no basis to judge.
* Read-only: never mutates the plan. Returns prefixed violation strings.
* Fail-closed: the public entry point never propagates an exception, but an
  internal crash is reported as an INTERNAL violation so an unverifiable card is
  rejected (the raw-markdown fallback ships) rather than passed through.
