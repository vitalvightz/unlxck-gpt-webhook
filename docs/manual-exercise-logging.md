# Optional exercise logging for manual training: audit and storage model

Athletes following their own coach's programme log a manual session (activity,
duration, effort). This feature lets them optionally record the movements they
did on that session, without creating an UNLXCK programme.

## Audit

- `external_training_sessions` is the occurrence: athlete-owned, no plan FK,
  retry key `(athlete_id, client_request_id)`, soft-deleted tombstones. Its
  activity/duration/effort already feed readiness, completed workload and
  sparring readiness (`training_history`, `completed_workload`). Nothing else
  should count the same workout again.
- `exercise_logs` is keyed by `(athlete_id, plan_id, training_day, block_id)`;
  `block_id` is a server-owned prescription identity and `status`
  (`as_prescribed` / `modified` / `skipped`) only means something against a
  frozen prescription. Today pre-fill (`recent_loads`) also reads it. Writing
  manual results there would need fake plan/block identities and would leak
  external work into prescribed-session behaviour. Not reused.
- The Exercise Library index (PR #2942) and progress (PR #2944) group by exact
  `exercise_key` (`key:`) or an unlinked log UUID (`log:`). Best loads keep kg
  and lb apart and never parse display strings.
- Session Details (PR #2940) shows manual sessions with no blocks.
- The training catalogue (`/api/training/library`) carries `exercise_key` in the
  same namespace as prescribed logs. `dose_guidance` already derives a dose
  mode from the catalogue's own evidence.
- Community exercises and private media are separate opt-in tables; nothing
  here touches them.

## Storage model (migration `20261019170000_add_manual_exercise_entries.sql`)

`personal_exercises` — an athlete's private movement names.
- Unique `(athlete_id, name_key)`; `name_key` folds case and whitespace only,
  so "Pause back squat" never merges with "Back squat". RLS: owner read only.

`manual_exercise_entries` — one recorded movement on one manual session.
- `external_session_id` → `external_training_sessions(id, athlete_id)`
  (composite FK keeps the link inside one athlete's records).
- Exactly one identity: catalogue `exercise_key` (validated server-side from a
  `catalogue_id`, or a key already in the athlete's records) or
  `personal_exercise_id` (composite FK to the same athlete).
- `display_name` snapshot, `measurement_format`
  (`strength`/`bodyweight`/`isometric`/`intervals`/`distance`), `actual`
  (exercise_logs' actual shape: only entered values), optional `notes`.
- Retry key `(athlete_id, client_entry_id)`; saves use
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so a retried PUT never adds a second
  occurrence. Deletes are tombstones; a late retry gets 410.
- `revision` orders edits. Each PUT names the revision it was based on (0 to
  create). An edit is a compare-and-set on that revision and bumps it by one.
  A replay of a save that already applied (stored revision = base + 1, same
  values) returns the stored row; anything older is 409. So a delayed retry of
  "80 kg" can never overwrite a later "90 kg" correction. The trigger only lets
  revisions step forward by one.
- Triggers: an insert takes the parent's `training_day`, needs a live parent and
  fewer than 30 live siblings (a retry of an existing entry passes through); an
  update cannot change owner, session, retry key or day, and cannot undelete.
  Updating the parent's day or `deleted_at` updates its entries in the same
  statement. The API also enforces each rule, and the store tombstones children
  on session delete.
- RLS: owner reads live rows only; only the service role writes.

## API

- `GET /api/training/sessions/{id}/exercises` — the live session's entries.
- `PUT /api/training/sessions/{id}/exercises/{entry_id}` — idempotent create or
  update (health-data consent required).
- `DELETE …/exercises/{entry_id}` — tombstone; repeat deletes succeed.
- `/api/training/history` adds `exercise_count` to manual rows (one batched read).
- `/api/training/history/external/{id}` returns entries as `blocks` with
  `source: "manual"` and an empty `prescribed`; nothing is compared.
- `/api/training/library?for_log=true` adds `log_format` from catalogue evidence,
  or null when it is ambiguous (the athlete then picks a format).
- Exercise Library and progress read both sources. `key:` identities merge
  prescribed and manual results; `custom:<uuid>` is a private `personal` identity;
  `log:` legacy records stay separate. Pagination is one `(training_day, id)`
  keyset across both tables, using the same as-of cutoff. Name-only entries are
  "performed, no measurements recorded"; they never become a zero or a best.

## Boundaries

- No workload, readiness, XP, streak, rehab exposure, injury clearance or
  sparring contact consumer reads the new tables. Tests assert those outputs are
  unchanged after adding entries.
- Repeating a session can reuse its exercise names. Previous values are shown as
  "Last time …" reference text; inputs start empty.
- Notes are health-adjacent free text: hidden from reads while consent is off.

## UI

- Log Training is unchanged. After a non-sparring save, the existing takeaway
  card gains one quiet "Add exercises" row. Sparring keeps its own follow-up.
- Session Details lists recorded exercises ("Back Squat · 3 × 5 · 80 kg") with
  Add/Edit exercises. The button closes the details sheet before opening the
  logger and reopens it afterwards, so only one modal is open at a time.
- The logger is one bottom sheet: search, then recent/recorded movements first,
  then catalogue matches, then "Add “name”". Selecting a movement shows one row
  of inputs for its format; "More details" holds rest, RPE, extra measures and
  notes. Each exercise is saved on Add, so closing never loses a finished row;
  Done saves an exercise in progress; closing with one unsaved asks first.

## Limits

- Max 30 exercises per session. Strength/bodyweight entries can optionally hold
  up to 50 confirmed `actual.set_entries` rows, each with its own reps and load.
  Common sets/reps/load remain compatibility summaries; varied values are never
  flattened into one weight. Existing aggregate logs remain valid.
- Catalogue formats are a suggestion from bank evidence; the athlete can change them.
- Renaming a personal exercise and merging a personal identity into a catalogue
  movement are not supported; both would need an explicit, reviewed action.
- The migration has not been applied to any hosted database.

## Per-set logging

- The compact Sets / Reps / Load entry remains the default. “Edit sets
  individually” expands the shared row editor; an edit changes only that set.
  “Apply to remaining sets” copies only the edited field to later sets.
- Planned-session logging seeds each row from exact prescribed values. Ranges
  stay hints, and missing measurements stay unknown. The S&C timer uses the same
  editor, shows one active set by default, and confirms it with “Set done”. Its
  saved run retains drafts; only completed sets are handed off to exercise logs.
- Session Details and exercise performance history use the shared, collapsed
  set summary and expand into compact read-only rows. Best-load records and load
  charts inspect the individual loads; a varied workout never becomes an
  invented sets × reps × maximum-load result.
- Both existing JSON columns accept the optional rows; no schema migration is
  needed. Deploy the API accepting `set_entries` before the frontend sends it.
