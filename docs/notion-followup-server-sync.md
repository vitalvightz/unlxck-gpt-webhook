# UNLXCK Notion follow-up sync (Hetzner)

This job keeps the editable **Copy Follow-Up** text equal to the existing **Follow-Up DM** formula. It never sends Instagram messages. It records **Last Follow-Up Sent** when it observes **Follow-Ups Sent** advance, which powers the existing **Actual Next Due** formula. No second set of DM scripts is hardcoded in Python. The recurring job uses the already-running worker container, not a new container each time.

## One-time server setup

1. **Reuse the existing outreach AI qualification integration.** The qualification worker already polls and writes the same UNLXCK Beta Candidate Pipeline every ~2 minutes, so do not make a new Notion integration or issue a second token. Check that its integration can update `Copy Follow-Up`, `Synced Follow-Ups Sent`, and `Last Follow-Up Sent`.
2. Check where that existing secret is injected. This script recognises `NOTION_TOKEN`, `NOTION_API_KEY`, or `NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` in its own process. If the qualification worker and Unlxck Docker worker already share one of these environment variables, no credential change is needed. **If the qualification worker is a separate service, the Docker worker does not automatically inherit its environment**: securely expose the *existing* token to the Docker worker via `/opt/unlxck/.env.production` or invoke this script from the existing qualification worker instead. Never print or commit the secret. The data source ID already points at the current pipeline; optionally set `NOTION_OUTREACH_DATA_SOURCE_ID`.
3. Merge this pull request only once checks have passed. Wait until the usual Hetzner backend deployment has built the new worker image. Prefer scheduling this job alongside the **existing outreach qualification poll** if its source/service is available, to avoid an unnecessary second Notion poll. Otherwise use the timer below.
4. Run once from /opt/unlxck to confirm that the **existing token is accessible within this container** and that writes succeed. Stop if it fails; do not generate a second token as a workaround:

    docker compose exec -T worker python tools/sync_notion_followups.py

5. Use a systemd timer to run every two minutes. Create /etc/systemd/system/unlxck-notion-followups.service:

    [Unit]
    Description=Sync UNLXCK Notion follow-ups
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/unlxck
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose exec -T worker python tools/sync_notion_followups.py

6. Create /etc/systemd/system/unlxck-notion-followups.timer:

    [Unit]
    Description=Sync UNLXCK follow-ups every two minutes
    [Timer]
    OnCalendar=*:0/2
    Persistent=true
    Unit=unlxck-notion-followups.service
    [Install]
    WantedBy=timers.target

7. Start the timer and check logs:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable --now unlxck-notion-followups.timer
    systemctl list-timers unlxck-notion-followups.timer
    sudo journalctl -u unlxck-notion-followups.service -n 30 --no-pager

The systemd timer lives on the host and calls the running worker. A run may fail while the worker restarts during backend deployment; the next scheduled run will retry. Confirm Docker is installed at /usr/bin/docker; replace that path if necessary.

## Behavior

- Follow-Ups Sent 0 → 1: update the copyable DM, mark the count as synced, and write the observed follow-up date.
- Follow-Ups Sent 1 → 2: clear the DM when the formula says the sales sequence is over.
- Replied and Accepted use the existing distinct Notion formula branches. Activated uses the existing feedback prompt.
- No changes are made to Rejected/Inactive or the AI queue.
- On first execution, a record with an unknown historical send date is **not assigned today's date**. The job only records dates for count increases it observes *after* baseline sync.
- The hidden server-owned field **Synced Follow-Ups Sent** distinguishes first observation from later changes. Do not manually edit it.
- Once this server job runs successfully, disable the existing Notion copy-text-sync automation so two systems do not overwrite the same field.
- Only one timer should run at a time. Errors are reported to the systemd journal and are retried at the next scheduled run.

Important: this is polling rather than an instantaneous webhook. Date recorded uses Europe/London on the day of observation (normally within two minutes), not a timestamp proven to be when the Instagram DM was sent. If a lead's count changes just before midnight and is observed after midnight, the observed date may differ from the actual send date. For exact timestamps, use a separate Mark Sent action.
