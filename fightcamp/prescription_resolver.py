"""Resolve effective physical prescriptions from scheduled-day/context envelopes.

Conditioning consumes closed composition ceilings in the same owner: verified
intervals may repeat, reduce, or restore one withheld round after contact relief.
It never creates calendar capacity or changes work/rest/effort together.

Exercise-bank prescriptions remain useful as the base dose, but scheduled-day
countdown and managed-contact rules are authoritative once a role has been placed
on the calendar. This module produces deterministic ``effective_prescription``
metadata so Stage 2 never has to reconcile conflicting base exercise text and
role-level caps.

Design contract (kept deliberately narrow):

* Countdown shaping still comes from ``apply_late_camp_role_morph``. This module
  never re-derives a countdown band.
* A role marked ``pre_hard_contact_managed_stress`` receives the existing
  D-17..D-14 strength-retention ceiling after placement: 3 x 3 max, RPE 6-7,
  loaded lifting allowed. A stricter countdown cap always wins.
* It is non-destructive: the exercise-bank prescription is preserved as
  ``base_prescription`` while the scheduled-day/context result is stored as
  ``effective_prescription`` and marked as the authoritative render dose.
* Exercise class matters. Anchor (primary loaded) work keeps the most meaningful
  loading the envelope allows; secondary loaded work loses more volume; support /
  trunk / prehab work loses sets but is never forced into low-rep strength reps;
  jumps / throws / neural power work keeps its own neural-quality reps. Loaded
  power/contrast work retains both its loaded-strength and ballistic semantics.
* Pre-hard-contact sessions keep one loaded anchor plus at most one genuinely
  low-cost power/support item; high impact, landing, eccentric or soreness-cost
  secondary work is excluded from the authoritative exercise allow-list.
* Athlete readiness / cut / injury state may only reduce the resolved dose
  further — never raise it above the scheduled-day/context ceiling.
