"""Compact Stage 2 finalizer packet.

This module converts the full internal Stage 2 payload into a small LLM-facing
packet. The full payload remains useful for debugging and tests, but the LLM
should not receive internal candidate pools, phase toolbox menus, or unused
rehab options.

Purpose:
- reduce LLM prompt bloat
- prevent GPP/SPP/TAPER toolbox leakage
- prevent rehab/prehab leakage when no active injury exists
- keep finalizer focused on selected sessions and render rules

    ``effective_strength_prescriptions``, and an explicit packet rule tells the

    embedded support item: a ``strength_slots`` assignment composed into a
    *conditioning* role, which never carries ``effective_strength_prescriptions``
    and so falls outside the strength-scoped rule entirely. Shipping its capped
    ``effective_prescription`` next to the uncapped bank dose left the finalizer
    two competing doses with nothing to separate them, and it could render the
