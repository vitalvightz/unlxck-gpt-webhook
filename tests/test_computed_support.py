"""Tests for the Stage 1 computed-support carry-through (PR-4).

Stage 1 computes nutrition/recovery/mindset numbers deterministically. These
tests pin that those numbers are emitted as structured data, bundled into the
planning brief, and fed UNTRUNCATED into the Stage 1 -> structured_plan
conversion prompt, with acute weight-cut / supplement dosing kept under a
coach-gated sub-section.
