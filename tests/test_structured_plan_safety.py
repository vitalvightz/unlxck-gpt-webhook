"""Tests for the deterministic-first authority + safety audits (PR-5).

The audits surface coach_gated leakage, computed_support vs structured_plan
conflicts, and duplicate rendered strings as prefixed findings. Findings are
severity-classified: LEAKAGE / CONFLICT / AUDIT_ERROR block the structured card
(``blocked_by_safety_audit`` — the card is discarded and never published);
DUPLICATE findings stay advisory warnings. The audits must never mutate the
plan and never resolve conflicts themselves.
