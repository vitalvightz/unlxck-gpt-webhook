 * Anti-drift checks for the in-app legal copy.
 *
 * The app ships its own rendering of the Terms and Privacy Notice so an athlete
 * can read what they are agreeing to at the moment they agree, which means two
 * copies exist and can diverge silently. These tests pin every substantive fact
 * — service-provider safeguards, the placeholders, the operator, the dates, the
 * versions — so a change to one has to be a deliberate change to the other.
 *
 * The canonical markdown now lives in this repo under docs/, so the final test
 * compares the two copies directly instead of relying on the pinned facts alone.
 * It holds the Service providers and International transfers paragraphs to a
 * verbatim match, because those are the ones where a silent divergence would
 * misdescribe who receives athlete data.
